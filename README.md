# ZMK config for the Dactyl Air keyboard

This is a ZMK configuration for my own 3x5 version of the Dactyl Manuform keyboard which I call the Dactyl Air.

If you want to build yourself a Dactyl Air keyboard, the model files are available on [Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5223795).
